=== What's This?

First experiments to add https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/[GraphQL Federation] to https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql[SmallRye GraphQL].

=== Howto Run

==== Node

There are two node services in `src/main/ts`:

* `content.ts`: a federated services delivering basic data about three films.
* `gateway.ts`: a federating service merging the schemas of the other two.

Start them with the `start-content-service` and `start-gateway` commands defined in the `package.json`

==== Java

The `pom.xml` builds a `war` that can run on a WildFly (tested with 23.0.0), either when the graphql feature pack is installed, or when built with the `fat` profile, so it includes the SmallRye GraphQL dependencies.

It contains the federation classes and a demo app delivering reviews for the films.

==== Testing

Open the gateway in http://localhost:4000

An example query is:
