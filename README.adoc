First experiments to add https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/[GraphQL Federation] to https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql[SmallRye GraphQL].

There are three node services in `src/main/ts`:

* `content.ts`: a federated services delivering basic data about three films.
* `review.ts`: a federated service delivering reviews for those films. This one is being replace with the Java demo app.
* `gateway.ts`: a federating service merging the schemas of the other two.

The `pom.xml` builds a `war` that can run on a WildFly (tested with 23.0.0), either when the graphql feature pack is installed, or when built with the `fat` profile, so it includes the SmallRye GraphQL dependencies.

It contains the federation classes and a demo app delivering the reviews. An example query is:
